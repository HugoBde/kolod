# KOLOD

## What is Kolod?
An emulator for Game Boy Advance, made in Rust because Rust is:
- [x] Faster
- [x] Safer
- [x] Cooler
- [x] Trendier

## Why Kolod?
Because the GBA was the first console I ever got, and I highly cherish the memories from those times.

## No but where does the name come from? I don't care about your stupid emulator
Oh, that? It's slang from my home country, just ignore it.
